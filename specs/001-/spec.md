# Feature Specification: Fix Compilation Errors

**Feature Branch**: `001-`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "îÑï"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Input provided: "îÑï" (Fix compilation errors)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: TypeScript compilation errors, type mismatches, missing properties
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All errors are clearly identified in compilation output
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User scenario: Developer runs build, encounters compilation errors, needs them fixed
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement corresponds to fixing specific compilation errors
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Components, TypeScript types, store methods
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed - errors are clearly defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the SAT20 wallet application, I need to fix TypeScript compilation errors so that the application can build successfully and maintain type safety throughout the codebase.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project has TypeScript compilation errors, **When** I run `bun run compile`, **Then** the build should complete without any TypeScript errors
2. **Given** the SignPsbt component has property access issues, **When** I reference component methods, **Then** the correct property names should be used
3. **Given** the wallet store is referenced multiple times, **When** the component code runs, **Then** variable declarations should not conflict
4. **Given** URL query parameters are used, **When** they are converted to numbers, **Then** proper type conversion should occur

### Edge Cases
- What happens when new TypeScript errors are introduced after fixing current ones?
- How does system handle type mismatches between different API versions?
- What occurs when optional properties are accessed without null checks?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fix property access errors in SignPsbt.vue component
- **FR-002**: System MUST resolve variable redeclaration conflicts for walletStore
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure missing store methods (signPsbt) are properly defined or implemented
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide proper type conversion for URL query parameters to numbers
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain type safety across all modified components
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure the build process completes successfully without TypeScript errors

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SignPsbt Component**: Vue component for PSBT signing functionality with method access issues
- **Wallet Store**: State management store containing wallet operations and methods
- **TypeScript Types**: Type definitions for component props, store methods, and data structures
- **Query Parameters**: URL parameters that require type conversion from strings to numbers
